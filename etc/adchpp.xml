		<!-- Logging, when enabled, is done to this file. The filename is first passed

<!-- Hub port -->
		<!-- Probably one of the most important settings, the hub port where the hub

			 Don't set below 256, 0 = disable. Experiment with this, it has many strange effects! -->
		<MaxSendSize type="int">4096</MaxSendSize>

		<!-- Another performance option. Enabling it will reduce the amount of memory used by dc++,
			 as data will be sent directly instead of buffering it (if possible). This is a good
			 thing, unless you've got a lot of users (say...400+), then you'll save both cpu and
			 bandwidth by disabling this feature, but memory consumption will go up a little bit.

		<DirectWrite type="int">0</DirectWrite>

		<!-- Because of the way the protocol works, a malicious user could send a 
			 command that would make the hub take all available memory on the
			 computer and crash it. Setting a limit here will fix this but also
			 limit the length of chat messages and pm:s people can send to each
			 other. If you set this too small, ADCH++ will stop working at all.
			 Users sending more than this will be disconnected. -->

			 when they're in the overflow state -->
		<KeepSlowUsers type="int">1</KeepSlowUsers>

		<!-- The minimum time in ms that data should be buffered before sending it (the hub will always
			 lag this much if direct writing is disabled). This is best used in conjunction with
			 direct writing disabled. Setting it to a reasonable value will save you bandwidth and
			 cpu because all sends during this period will be joined into one packet. Don't 
			 set below 50, 0 = disable. Highly recommended to keep enabled. -->
		<WriteTimeout type="int">200</WriteTimeout>

		<!-- Buffer size, this is the minimum buffer size that is initially assigned to
			 each user. Larger buffer = more memory usage / user, less = a little bit
			 slower performance if the user sends more than these many bytes at a time
			 (in a chat message for instance...). Don't set to lower than 256. -->
		<BufferSize type="int">512</BufferSize>
		
		<!-- Timeout (ms) before ADCH++ stops trying to empty its send buffer for a user

	<!-- Instead of scripts, ADCH++ uses plugins. Plugins can do the same work
		 as scripts, are more difficult to write, but when it comes to performance,
		 the difference between the two is absurd. This way, it's also possible to
		 write a script plugin, enabling people to choose their own script language,
		 if someone's written a script plugin for it. You must specify the path to your
		 plugins in linux!!! -->
