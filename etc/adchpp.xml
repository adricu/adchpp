	<!-- Instead of scripts, ADCH++ uses plugins. Plugins can do the same work
		 as scripts, are more difficult to write, but when it comes to performance,
		 the difference between the two is absurd. This way, it's also possible to
		 write a script plugin, enabling people to choose their own script language,
		 if someone's written a script plugin for it. You must specify the path to your
		 plugins in linux!!! -->
