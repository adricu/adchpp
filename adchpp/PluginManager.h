/**
 * @page PluginAPI Plugin API Information
 * @section General General
 *
 * ADCH++ contains a rather powerful plugin API that can be used to create advanced
 * plugins that change or add to ADCH++'s behaviour. Most plugins will need
 * PluginManager.h, ClientManager.h and Client.h included to work, even though the
 * other header files are available as well (they're more likely to change in future
 * versions though). You can use any method that is declared as DLL or is inline, the
 * others are meant to be internal to ADCH++, very likely to change/disappear and will
 * generate link errors (when compiling under windows anyway). When starting a plugin
 * project I strongly recommend that you take one of the existing plugins and modify
 * it to your needs (to get all compiler settings and base code right).
 *
 * @section Versions Versions
 *
 * Due to C++ name mangling, plugins are generally valid only for a certain version
 * of the ADCH++ plugin API. This version usually follows the main ADCH++ version,
 * unless a small update is made that I judge shouldn't affect plugins in any way.
 * Most of the time, recompiling the plugin should be enough, unless any major changes
 * have been made, and your plugin doesn't rely on the nasty internals.
 *
 * @section Threads Threads
 *
 * ADCH++ has two main threads running when operating. One handles all network
 * communication while the other does all other work (handle protocol data and
 * so on). All plugins are run in the worker thread, which is the only thread
 * visible to the API. You are only allowed to interact with ADCH++ from this
 * thread, as none of the API is thread safe, unless otherwise noted. This has a
 * few important  consequences. First off, you can assume that your plugin will
 * only be called by this thread, which means that you don't have to worry about
 * multithreading issues unless you start threads by yourself. Second, any work you
 * do in a plugin halts <b>all</b> of ADCH++'s processing (apart from receiving/sending
 * buffered data), in other words, don't do any lengthy processing in the on methods,
 * as the whole of ADCH++ will suffer. Third, if you indeed start another thread, make
 * sure you don't use any API functions from it apart from those explicitly marked
 * as thread safe. To indicate from a plugin that you have work to do in the main
 * worker thread, call PluginManager::attention().
