= ADCH++ - A hub software for ADC

== Introduction

ADCH++ is a hub for the ADC network. It implements the
http://dcplusplus.sf.net/ADC.html[ADC protocol]. The core application is very
simple, but extensible using plugins. Among the standard plugins there is a
scripting plugin that allows hub owners to further customize the hub using 
several scripting languages.

== License

ADCH++ is licensed under the GPL. For details, see license.txt supplied with
the application. A side effect of the license is that any plugins you write
must be released under a license compatible with the GPL.
